# A Framework To Simplify Developments

A **framework helps you work better** (structuring developments)
and faster (reusing generic modules).

A framework **facilitates long-term maintenance** and **scalability** by
complying with standard development rules.

Compliance with development standards also simplifies integrating and
interfacing the application with the rest of the information system.

In other words, it works as a tool to make the development process
easier and more productive.

Most of the time, a framework implements many kinds of **design patterns**.
