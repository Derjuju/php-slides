# Getting Started (2/2)

The best solution is to use a Virtual Machine (VM):
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/).

    !bash
    $ vagrant box add squeeze64 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/937870/VMs/squeeze64.box
    $ vagrant init squeeze64
    $ vagrant up

Then, ssh into your VM:

    !bash
    $ vagrant ssh
