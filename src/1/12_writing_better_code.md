# Coding Standards

    !php
    <?php

    namespace Vendor\Model;

    class Foo
    {
        const VERSION = '1.0';

        public $bar = null;

        protected $opts;

        private $var3 = 123;

        public function __construct(BarInterface $bar, array $opts = [])
        {
            $this->bar  = $bar;
            $this->opts = $opts;
        }
    }

# PHP Coding Standards Fixer

The PHP Coding Standards Fixer tool fixes most issues in your code when
you want to follow the PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1 and
PSR-2 documents.

Installation:

    !bash
    $ wget http://cs.sensiolabs.org/get/php-cs-fixer.phar

Usage:

    !bash
    $ php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/dir/or/file

# Programming To The Interface

Reduces dependency on implementation specifics and makes code more reusable.

The `BananaController` can use either **Twig** or the raw PHP implementation
as template engine thanks to the `TemplateEngineInterface`:

    !php
    interface TemplateEngineInterface
    {
        /**
         * @param string $template
         * @param array  $parameters
         *
         * @return string
         */
        public function render($template, array $parameters = []);
    }

You should think about interfaces, not about internal implementation details.

# Component Driven Development

Itâ€™s all about **Separation of Concerns** (SoC).

You design components with their own logic, each component does **one thing
well**, and **only one thing**.

How to manage these components in your application?

# Dependency Injection

Design Pattern that allows a choice of component to be made at **runtime**
rather than compile time.

Most of the time, you rely on configuration files to describe your **classes**
and their **dependencies**.

A **class** in this context is also known as a **service**, and all services live
in a **service container** or **dependency injection container**.

You ask this container to retrieve a service, and it is **lazy loaded** and dynamically
built:

    !php
    // It's an instance of TemplateEngineInterface, but you don't know
    // anything about its internal implementation.
    // Is it the raw PHP implementation or Twig?
    $engine = $container->get('template_engine');

# Dependency Injection

### Constructor Injection

All dependencies are **injected** using a **constructor**:

    !php
    class Foo
    {
        private $bar;

        public function __construct(BarInterface $bar)
        {
            $this->bar = $bar;
        }
    }

---

# Dependency Injection

### Setter Injection

Dependencies are **injected** through **setters**:

    !php
    class Foo
    {
        private $bar;

        public function setBar(BarInterface $bar)
        {
            $this->bar = $bar;
        }
    }

---

# Dependency Injection

### Interface Injection

An interface describes the **injection**:

    !php
    interface BarAware
    {
        public function setBar(BarInterface $bar);
    }

It needs to be implemented by the class that wants to use a `BarInterface`:

    !php
    class Foo implements BarAware
    {
        private $bar;

        public function setBar(BarInterface $bar)
        {
            $this->bar = $bar;
        }
    }

# PHP Implementations

### Twittee

[Twittee](https://github.com/fabpot/twittee) is the **smallest** Dependency Injection
Container written in PHP.
It fits in a _tweet_ (less than 140 characters):

    !php
    class Container
    {
        protected $s = array();

        function __set($k, $c)
        {
            $this->s[$k] = $c;
        }

        function __get($k)
        {
            return $this->s[$k]($this);
        }
    }

---

# PHP Implementations

### Pimple

[Pimple](https://github.com/fabpot/Pimple) is a small Dependency Injection Container
for PHP 5.3 that consists of just one file and one class.

### The Symfony2 DependencyInjection Component

The [DependencyInjection](https://github.com/symfony/DependencyInjection) component
allows you to standardize and centralize the way objects are constructed in your
application.

# Object Calisthenics

**9 rules** invented by Jeff Bay in his book [The ThoughWorks
Anthology](http://pragprog.com/book/twa/thoughtworks-anthology):

1. Only One Level Of Indentation Per Method
2. Don't Use The ELSE Keyword
3. Wrap All Primitives And Strings
4. First Class Collections
5. One Dot Per Line
6. Don't Abbreviate
7. Keep All Entities Small
8. No Classes With More Than Two Instance Variables
9. No Getters/Setters/Properties
