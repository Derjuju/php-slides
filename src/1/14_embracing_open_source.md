# Golden Rules

* Read other people's code is the fastest way to learn;
* Think about what you have to do;
* Read the code, not the doc;
* Never trust the user;
* Think again;
* Simple is always better than complicated;
* Keep your code readable;
* Test your code, it eases refactoring;
* Keep [HTTP protocol](http://pretty-rfc.herokuapp.com/RFC2616) in mind.
